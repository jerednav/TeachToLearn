# Teach To Learn
My goal is to review web development foundations mainly JavaScript and it's frameworks, and hopefully teach myself about web development and also by teaching others. My goal is to learn more about web development by teaching and writing the concepts into my own words. The best way to learn is by teaching.

I will start my journey at JavaScript and build up from there. From this course, you should already have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and general knowledge of computers/internet.
