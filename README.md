# Teach To Learn
My goal is to review web development foundations mainly JavaScript and it's frameworks, and hopefully teach myself about web development and also by teaching others. My ultimate goal is to have an all in one source for learning JavaScript combining many different sources. I will start my journey at JavaScript and build up from there. From this course, you should already have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and general knowledge of computers/internet.
