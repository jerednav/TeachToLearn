# Basic Variables
### What is a variable?
- A variable is the name for where data is stored.
- Think of a variable as a box that holds items for storage

### Variable Properties
There are 3 main properties of a variable:
- the **name**
- it's **value**
- the **type**

### Variable Assignment
To create, or **declare** a variable, use the *let* keyword then the *name* of the variable

```
let box
```

You can also assign **value** to the variable, using the ```=``` operator.

You can also create multiple values in one line and reassign values.

```
let box = 'toys'
let box2 = 'decorations'
box = 'clothes'
```

A good way to understand the concept of a **variable** is to think of a box having items stored in it. That is what a variable is essentially doing in JavaScript. We assign certain items into the variable but are also able to replace, or reassign them to other values.
